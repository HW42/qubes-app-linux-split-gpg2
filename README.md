# split-gpg2

## About split-gpg2

This software allows you to separate the handling of private key material from the rest of GnuPG's processing.
This is similar to how smartcards work, except that in this case the handling of the private key is not put into some small microcontroller but into another Qubes domain.

Since GnuPG 2.1.0 the private gpg keys are handled by the gpg-agent.
This allows to split `gpg` (the cmdline tool - handles public keys, etc.) and the `gpg-agent` which handles the private keys.
This software implements this for Qubes.
This mainly constists of a restrictive filter in front of `gpg-agent`, written in a memory safe language (python).

The server is the domain which runs the (real) `gpg-agent` and has access to your private key material.
The client is the domain in which you run `gpg` and which accesses the server via Qubes RPC.

The server domain is generally considered more trustfull then the client domain.
This implies that the response from the server is _not_ santizied.


## Requirements

 - Python 3.5 or newer
 - GnuPG 2.1 or newer

## Building

Add it as a component to [qubes-builder](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-builder) and built it.

For development you can also build the Debian packet in tree.
Just run `dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc` at the top level.

## Installation

Install the the deb or the rpm on your TemplateVM(s).

Install the dom0-rpm in dom0 or just create `/etc/qubes-rpc/policy/qubes.Gpg2` by hand.

## Configuration

Import/Generate your secret keys in the server domain.
For example:
```
gpg-server-vm$ gpg --import /path/to/my/secret-keys-export
gpg-server-vm$ gpg --import-ownertrust /path/to/my/ownertrust-export
```
or
```
gpg-server-vm$ gpg --gen-key
```

Now configure which domain the client VM should use as server. Either:
 - Set the target for `@default` in qubes.Gpg2. or
 - Write `SPLIT_GPG2_SERVER_DOMAIN=<gpg-server>` into `~user/.config/.split-gpg2-rc`.

Enable the `split-gpg2-client` service in the client domain either via the GUI or via `qvm-service gpg-client-vm split-gpg2-client on`.
Restart the client domain.

Export the **public** part of your keys and import them in the client domain.
Also import/set proper "ownertrust" values.
For example:
```
gpg-server-vm$ gpg --export > public-keys-export
gpg-server-vm$ gpg --export-ownertrust > ownertrust-export
gpg-server-vm$ qvm-copy my-keys-pub.gpg

gpg-client-vm$ gpg --import ~/QubesIncoming/gpg-server-vm/public-keys-export
gpg-client-vm$ gpg --import-ownertrust ~/QubesIncoming/gpg-server-vm/ownertrust-export

```

This should be enough to have it running:
```
gpg-client-vm$ gpg -K
/home/user/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
-----------------------------
sec#  rsa2048 2019-12-18 [SC] [expires: 2021-12-17]
      50C2035AF57B98CD6E4010F1B808E4BB07BA9EFB
uid           [ultimate] test
ssb#  rsa2048 2019-12-18 [E]
```

If you want change some server option copy `/usr/share/doc/split-gpg2/examples/split-gpg2-rc.example` to `~user/.config/split-gpg2-rc` and change it as desired.

If you have a passphrase on your keys and `gpg-agent` only shows the "keygrip" (something like the fingerprint of the private key) when asking for the passphrase, then make sure that you have imported the public key part in the server domain.

## Advanced usage

There are a few option not described in this README.
See the comments in the example config and the source code.

Similar to a smartcard split-gpg2 only tries to protect the private key.
For advanced usages consider if a speciaized RPC service would be better.
It could do things like checking what data is singed, detailed logging, exposing the encrypted content only to a VM without network, etc.
